                    Hello! Thanks for checking out my supplemental page for CS 61A {% SEMESTER %}. I will post slides, worksheets, and any other material I use during my sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Jemmy and I am a fourth year Computer Science major from the Bay Area (Fremont!). Taking AP Computer Science during my senior year of high school sparked my interested in computer science. I thought I had a decent understanding of the core CS concepts at the time, but while taking CS 61A, I quickly realized there was a LOT of fundamentals I have never even heard of. While CS 61A is definitely a challenging class, the myriad of skills introduced definitely make the journey worth it. And I'm here to help!
                </p>

                    Since Spring 2018, I Academic Interned for 1 semester, Tutored for 5 semester, and TA-ed for 1 semester. While this isn't my first rodeo when it comes to teaching CS 61A, this will be the first time teaching large sections in an online format. I will likely spend the first few sections adjusting to find the best way to hold these sections, and I would love to hear any suggestions/feedback from everyone! Please send me <a href="https://forms.gle/thhtwLmhEGgTbYkC7" target="_blank">a message here</a>.

                    <b>P.S. There's some really cool projects, like making a type racer and coding a similar game to Plants vs. Zombies!</b>
